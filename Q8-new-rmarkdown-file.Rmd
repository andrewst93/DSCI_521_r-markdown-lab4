```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# This is my number 1 favorite header

And this is an awesome markdown table:

|       | Column 1 | Column 2 |
|:-----:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Row 1 |  Val 11  |  Val 12  |
| Row 2 |  Val 21  |  Val 22  |

And some quick maths:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
vector1 <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)

paste0("The sum of the vector [", paste(vector1, collapse= ","), "] is ", sum(vector1))
```

# My second favorite section is this one

It's because it is made of pi(e).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
paste(round(pi, 10))
```
