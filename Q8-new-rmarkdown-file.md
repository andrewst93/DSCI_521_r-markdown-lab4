# This is my number 1 favorite header

And this is an awesome markdown table:

|       | Column 1 | Column 2 |
|:-----:|:--------:|:--------:|
| Row 1 |  Val 11  |  Val 12  |
| Row 2 |  Val 21  |  Val 22  |

And some quick maths:

    ## [1] "The sum of the vector [1,2,3,4,5,6] is 21"

# My second favorite section is this one

Itâ€™s because it is made of pi(e).

    ## [1] "3.1415926536"
